				<h1>The Inspiration</h1>
				<p class="p-content">Have you ever considered the possibilty that each one of us is a universe of our own. The sections of our bodies are different planets which are then divided into different countries with each cell as a different being.</p>

				<p class="p-content">I often wonder weather this can also explain diseases like cancer where your body is atacking itsel, could this be a represenation of countries at war? It makes a lot of sense to me as the more we take our focus more inward, we become beautiful versions of ourselves which in turn creates beauty all around is.</p>

				<p class="p-content">It is only when we are insecure, loathing ourselves and unhappy that we reflect that out onto others, so it makes perfect sense for us to focus on oursleves in a divine way to be the best versions of ourselves. If in one moment every being in the entire universe focussed inwardly being the best version of oursleves, then it that moment we've changed the enitre world.</p>

				<p class="p-content">As famously said before, if you want to change the world, you should start with yourself. I want to live in a kinder, more peaceful, free, ecstatic and blissful world. Therefore I am starting with myself by trying to be kinder, more peaceful, ecstatic, blissful and  more free. I encourage you all to create that chnage within yourselves.</p>
